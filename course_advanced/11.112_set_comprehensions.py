# Some coders have developed the habit of putting constants first in '==' comparisons. 
# If '=' were accidentally typed, this makes the constant an l-value in an assignment 
# and the compiler or interpreter would complain, drawing the coder's attention 
# to the error.




# Interesting point, putting the variable on the right side of a comparison would prevent
# accidental assignment.
# It's rare that I get a student who is an experienced programmer and can help me improve
# the course, so your feedback has been very valuable. I am currently working on 
# remastering the course. That includes re-filming the course videos and creating 
# additional review exercises and programming challenges.  I also plan on making videos
# going over the exercises and programming challenges, so it will be a while until 
# the remaster is complete. I expect to be finished no later than the end of October
# and will make an announcement about it a week before I expect to have it completed. 

# In the meantime, I will make any helpful comments you make into featured questions 
# so that I can find them easier and make changes to my lectures if necessary during 
# the re-filming process.
